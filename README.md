# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis (K-Means Clustering)

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior and identifying meaningful customer segments using **K-Means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
The main objective is to understand customer purchasing patterns and group similar customers together so businesses can make better marketing and sales decisions.

---

## Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to:

* Understand different customer types
* Personalize offers and marketing
* Improve customer retention

This project solves that problem by **segmenting customers based on their shopping behavior**.

---

## Approach

The analysis follows a structured data science workflow:

1. Data understanding and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature selection and scaling
4. Finding optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**
5. Applying **K-Means clustering**
6. Interpreting customer segments
7. Presenting insights using visualizations and dashboards

---

## Techniques Used

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature scaling
* Elbow Method
* K-Means clustering
* Cluster visualization
* Business insight interpretation

---

## Key Insights

* Customers can be grouped into distinct segments based on spending and purchasing behavior
* Each cluster represents a different type of customer (low value, medium value, high value, etc.)
* These segments help businesses:

  * Target customers more effectively
  * Improve marketing ROI
  * Build customer-specific strategies

---

## Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Scikit-learn (K-Means)
* SQL (trend and aggregation analysis)
* Power BI (dashboard visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## Project Files

* **Jupyter Notebook** – Complete analysis and clustering logic
* **PDF Report** – Business explanation and insights
* **SQL File** – Query-based analysis
* **Power BI Dashboard** – Interactive visual insights

---

## Business Value

* Helps businesses understand customer behavior
* Enables data-driven decision making
* Supports targeted marketing and personalization strategies

---

## Conclusion

The reason for doing this study is not only to divide people into groups based on their shopping behavior, 
and not to calculate profit/loss, product quantity, or margins directly.
This machine learning practice is mainly focused on understanding patterns, predicting trends, 
and visualizing groups of customers to support future business decisions.

Using K-Means clustering / customer segmentation on a shopping platform helps businesses understand 
how different groups of people follow trends, how their behavior changes over time, and how they respond to offers or discounts.
These insights can then be used to plan future discount strategies, set margin goals, 
and design targeted offers in a more data-driven way rather than relying on assumptions.

Overall, this project demonstrates how clustering can be used as a decision-support tool,
helping businesses visualize customer behavior today and prepare better strategies for tomorrow.
